            When he unveiled the iPhone in January 2007, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs made headlines with other big news. The company, which had become a household brand with the Macintosh, was dropping “Computer” from its name and would now be billed as just Apple Inc.

        <p class="bar">
            “We’ve added to the Mac and the iPod. We’ve added Apple TV and now iPhone. The Mac is the only one you really think of as a computer,” Jobs told more than 5,000 cheering Apple fans at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco. “So we thought maybe our name should reflect this.”

        <p class="gup">
            Nearly a decade later, that bet shows just how good Jobs was at seeing into the future. Apple has morphed from a niche computer maker into a consumer electronics juggernaut, with nearly two thirds of its $216 billion in annual sales now from the iPhone. The Mac, including laptops marketed under the MacBook brand, represents just 11 percent of revenue. Even so, those computers make up a healthy $20-plus billion a year business.

            Those numbers are worth noting, given that Jobs started talking up the “post-PC” era in 2010, saying we’d eventually favor mobile devices over computers. And it goes some way toward explaining why die-hard Mac fans complain that Apple has been neglecting its computers and tinkering instead with the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.
